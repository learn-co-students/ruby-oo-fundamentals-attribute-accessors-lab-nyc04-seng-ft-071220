# require 'pry

class Cat 
attr_accessor:name

 def meow
   puts "meow!"
 end


end

# notes to self make sure you are wrtting everything as required , if asked !! then inculde wasted too much time on this !
#  create a class for cat 
# next create your attr_accessor to access your instance name ! 
# define "meow" and "puts" it out = "meow!". end ,end
